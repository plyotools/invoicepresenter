# Cursor Control Center - Mandatory Rules

**CRITICAL**: You MUST read and follow ALL rules in the `.cursor/rules/` directory. These rules are MANDATORY and apply to ALL conversations.

## Required Reading

Before responding to any request, you MUST be aware of these rules:

### PRIMARY RULES (Read First):
1. **`.cursor/rules/agent-comm.mdc`** - Communication rules, command execution, debugging flows
2. **`.cursor/rules/coding-principles.mdc`** - Coding standards, best practices, AI agent guidelines

**CRITICAL**: These two rules work together - agent-comm defines HOW to communicate, coding-principles defines WHAT standards to follow. Both are mandatory.

### WORKFLOW RULES:
3. **`.cursor/rules/launch.mdc`** - Launch command procedures
4. **`.cursor/rules/release.mdc`** - Release command procedures
5. **`.cursor/rules/runtime.mdc`** - Runtime and logging rules
6. **`.cursor/rules/ship.mdc`** - Ship It command rules

## Key Principles You MUST Follow

- **MANDATORY: End every response with**: "In accordance with coding principles and agreed communications I have..." followed by what you actually did to practice them (proof of compliance through demonstrated actions)
- **User is NOT a developer** - Use simple, clear language - avoid technical jargon
- **Keep it short** - Be concise and to the point - avoid lengthy explanations
- **Always provide recommendations** - Don't just explain, provide actionable next steps
- **If stuck, recommend research** - Suggest researching external implementations with similar issues
- **When user reports an issue**: Find acceptance criteria, define verification, fix it, verify it works, don't stop until proven fixed
- **NEVER say "fixed" without verification** - Always test and prove the fix works first
- **NEVER ask users to run terminal commands** - execute them yourself or provide copy-paste code blocks
- **Always read files directly** - never ask users to check logs, ports, or configurations
- **Execute commands directly** - use available tools to run commands unless physically impossible
- **Verify by reading files** - check `.dev.log`, `.cursor/ports.json`, etc. directly
- **Follow all workflow rules** - launch, release, ship commands have specific procedures

## Rule Enforcement

- These rules are synced from the Cursor Control Center
- Rules version is tracked in `.cursor/control-center.json`
- **Agency Principle**: When rules are updated in Control Center, they automatically apply to ALL projects
- **Distribution reporting**: The sync command reports how many projects received updates
- If rules seem outdated, check the version and sync if needed
- All rules are MANDATORY - not suggestions or optional guidelines

## When Starting a Conversation

1. Check if `.cursor/rules/` directory exists
2. **Read BOTH `agent-comm.mdc` AND `coding-principles.mdc` together** - they work as a pair
3. Understand: agent-comm = HOW to communicate, coding-principles = WHAT standards to follow
4. Follow all rules consistently throughout the conversation

## Shorthand Reminders

- **"CP" = Coding Principles**: When user types "CP" anywhere, immediately review and apply coding principles
- **Corrective reminder**: User can write "CP" at any point if they believe you're not following principles - treat it as a signal to review and correct
- **Read coding-principles.mdc**: Use "CP" as a reminder to check your work against all standards
- **Works anywhere**: "CP" can be used at any point in the conversation as a reminder or corrective signal

**Remember**: These rules ensure consistency, quality, and efficiency across all projects. Following them is not optional.
