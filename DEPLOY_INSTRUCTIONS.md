# Easy Deployment Instructions

## Step 1: Create the Repository on GitHub

1. **Open your web browser** and go to:
   ```
   https://github.com/organizations/plyotools/repositories/new
   ```
   (Or go to github.com, click your profile → Your organizations → plyotools → Repositories → New)

2. **Fill in the form:**
   - **Repository name:** Type `invoicepresenter` (all lowercase, no spaces)
   - **Description:** (optional) "Invoice Presenter app"
   - **Visibility:** Choose Public or Private (your choice)
   - **IMPORTANT:** Do NOT check any of these boxes:
     - ❌ Add a README file
     - ❌ Add .gitignore
     - ❌ Choose a license
   - Leave all of them unchecked!

3. **Click the green "Create repository" button**

4. **You'll see a page with setup instructions - that's okay, just close it or ignore it**

## Step 2: Push Your Code

Once you've created the repository, come back here and I'll push the code for you!

Just let me know when Step 1 is done.
